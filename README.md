# ML-Project-ShipNet-
This project uses an E‑commerce shipping dataset to predict whether customer orders are delivered on time or not. The target variable Reached.on.Time_Y.N indicates on‑time delivery (1) and late delivery (0), so the task is a binary classification problem. The motivation is that understanding and predicting late deliveries can help E‑commerce companies improve customer satisfaction, optimize logistics, and design better discount strategies. To solve this problem, several supervised machine learning algorithms are applied: K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and a Neural Network (MLP). In addition, KMeans clustering is used to treat the data as an unsupervised learning problem and explore natural groupings of shipments. These models are trained, tested, and compared using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and ROC–AUC.
